## 6 Functional Block Description

### 6.1 MCU Interface

### 6.1.1 MCU Interface selection

The SSD1680 can support 3-wire/4-wire serial peripheral. MCU interface is pin selectable by BS1 shown in Table 6-1.

**Table 6-1: Interface pins assignment under different MCU interface**
|  |  | **Pin Name** |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MCU Interface** | **BS1** | **RES#** | **CS#** | **D/C#** | **SCL** | **SDA** |
| 4-wire serial peripheral interface (SPI) | L | RES# | CS# | DC# | SCL | SDA |
| 3-wire serial peripheral interface (SPI) – 9 bits SPI | H | RES# | CS# | L | SCL | SDA |

**Note**
(1) L is connected to VSS and H is connected to VDDIO

### 6.1.2 MCU Serial Interface (4-wire SPI)

The 4-wire SPI consists of serial clock SCL, serial data SDA, D/C# and CS#. The control pins status in 4-wire SPI in writing command/data is shown in Table 6-2 and the write procedure 4-wire SPI is shown in Table 6-2

**Table 6-2: Control pins status of 4-wire SPI**
| Function | SCL pin | SDA pin | D/C# pin | CS# pin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Write command | ↑ | Command bit | L | L |
| Write data | ↑ | Data bit | H | L |

**Note:**
(1) L is connected to VSS and H is connected to VDDIO
(2) ↑ stands for rising edge of signal
(3) SDA (Write Mode) is shifted into an 8-bit shift register on every rising edge of SCL in the order of D7, D6, ... D0. The level of D/C# should be kept over the whole byte. The data byte in the shift register is written to the Graphic Display Data RAM (RAM)/Data Byte register or command Byte register according to D/C# pin.

*[Timing Diagram: CS#, D/C#, SCL, and SDA signal waveforms]*

**Figure 6-1: Write procedure in 4-wire SPI mode**

In the read operation (Command 0x1B, 0x27, 0x2D, 0x2E, 0x2F, 0x35). After CS# is pulled low, the first byte sent is command byte, D/C# is pulled low. After command byte sent, the following byte(s) read are data byte(s), so D/C# bit is then pulled high. An 8-bit data will be shifted out on every clock falling edge. The serial data SDA bit shifting sequence is D7, D6, to D0 bit. Figure 6-2 shows the read procedure in 4-wire SPI.

*[Timing Diagram: CS#, D/C#, SCL, and SDA (Write Mode/Read Mode) signal waveforms]*

**Figure 6-2: Read procedure in 4-wire SPI mode**

### 6.1.3 MCU Serial Peripheral Interface (3-wire SPI)

The 3-wire SPI consists of serial clock SCL, serial data SDA and CS#. The operation is similar to 4-wire SPI while D/C# pin is not used and it must be tied to LOW. The control pins status in 3-wire SPI is shown in Table 6-3.

In the write operation, a 9-bit data will be shifted into the shift register on every clock rising edge. The bit shifting sequence is D/C# bit, D7 bit, D6 bit to D0 bit. The first bit is D/C# bit which determines the following byte is command or data. When D/C# bit is 0, the following byte is command. When D/C# bit is 1, the following byte is data. Table 6-3 shows the write procedure in 3-wire SPI

**Table 6-3: Control pins status of 3-wire SPI**
| Function | SCL pin | SDA pin | D/C# pin | CS# pin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Write command | ↑ | Command bit | Tie LOW | L |
| Write data | ↑ | Data bit | Tie LOW | L |

**Note:**
(1) L is connected to VSS and H is connected to VDDIO
(2) ↑ stands for rising edge of signal

*[Timing Diagram: CS#, SCL, and SDA (Write Mode) signal waveforms showing 9-bit sequence]*

**Figure 6-3: Write procedure in 3-wire SPI**

In the read operation (Register 0x1B, 0x27, 0x2D, 0x2E, 0x2F, 0x35). SDA data are transferred in the unit of 9 bits. After CS# pull low, the first byte is command byte, the D/C# bit is as 0 and following with the register byte. After command byte send, the following byte(s) are data byte(s), with D/C# bit is 1. After D/C# bit sending from MCU, an 8-bit data will be shifted out on every clock falling edge. The serial data SDA bit shifting sequence is D7, D6, to D0 bit. Figure 6-4 shows the read procedure in 3-wire SPI.

*[Timing Diagram: CS#, SCL, SDA (Write mode/Read Mode)]*

**Figure 6-4 : Read procedure in 3-wire SPI mode**

### 6.2 OSCILLATOR
The oscillator module generates the clock reference for waveform timing and analog operations.

### 6.3 BOOSTER & REGULATOR
A voltage generation system is included in the driver. It provides all necessary driving voltages required for an AMEPD panel including VGH, VGL, VSH1, VSH2, VSL and VCOM. External application circuit is needed to make the on-chip booster & regulator circuit work properly.

*[Schematic: Booster & Regulator Circuit]*

### 6.4 VCOM SENSING

### 6.6 Programmable Waveform for Gate, Source and VCOM

*[Diagram: Gate waveform and Programmable Source and VCOM waveform illustration]*

**Figure 6-5 : Gate waveform and Programmable Source and VCOM waveform illustration**

In the programmable waveform for Source and VCOM, there are 12 groups (Group0 to Group11) and each group has 4 phases (Phase A to Phase D) and 2 state repeats (Phase A and B, Phase C and D). Totally, there are 48 phases. In addition, in each phase, the phase length (TP[nX]) can be set by number of frame from 0 to 255 frames. Also, each group can be repeated with repeat counting number (RP[n]) from 1 to 256 times; each AB / CD phases can be repeated with state repeat counting number (SR[nAB]/SR[nCD]) from 1 to 256 times. For the voltage, there is four levels for Source voltage (VSS, VSH1, VSH2, VSL) and three levels for VCOM voltage (DCVCOM, VSH1+DCVCOM, VSL+DCVCOM).

The description of each parameter is as follows.

1) TP[nX] represents the phase length set by the number of frame.
    - The range of TP[nX] is from 0 to 255.
    - n represents the Group number from 0 to 11; X represents the phase number from A to D.
    - When TP[nX] = 0, the phase is skipped. When TP[nX] = 1, the phase is 1 frame, and so on. The maximum phase length is 255 frame.

2) RP[n] represents the repeat counting number for the Group.
    - The range of RP[n] is from 0 to 255.
    - n represents the Group number from 0 to 11.
    - RP[n] = 0 indicates that the repeat times = 1, RP[n] = 1 indicates that the repeat times = 2, and so on. The maximum repeat times is 256.

3) SR[nAB] and SR[nCD] represent the state repeat counting number for Phase A & B and Phase C & D respectively.
    - The range of SR[nXY] is from 0 to 255.
    - n represents the Group number from 0 to 11.
    - SR[nXY] = 0 indicates that the repeat times = 1, SR[nXY] = 1 indicates that the repeat times = 2, and so on. The maximum repeat times is 256.

4) VS[nX-LUTm] represents Source and VCOM voltage level which is used in each phase. Table 6-6 shows the voltage settings for source voltage and VCOM voltage.
    - n represents the Group number from 0 to 11.
    - m represents the LUT number from 0-4.

**Table 6-6 : VS[nX-LUTm] settings for Source voltage and VCOM voltage**
| VS[nX-LUTm] | Source voltage | VCOM voltage |
|---|---|---|
| 00 | VSS | DCVCOM |
| 01 | VSH1 | VSH1 + DCVCOM |
| 10 | VSL | VSL + DCVCOM |
| 11 | VSH2 | N/A |

5) FR[n] indicates the frame rate of group n
    - The range of FR [n] is from 0 to 7.
    - n represents the Group number from 0 to 11.

6) XON[nAB] and XON[nCD], indicates the gate scan selection.
    - n represents the Group number from 0 to 11.
    - XON[nXY] = 0 indicates Normal gate scan in Phase[nX] & Phase[nY].
    - XON[nXY] = 1 indicates All gate on, that Gate keeps High until the phase for normal gate scan, in Phase[nX] & Phase[nY].

### 6.7 WAVEFORM SETTING
As described in Section 6.6, parameters VS[nX-LUTm], TP[nX], RP[n], SR[nXY], FR[n] and XON[nXY] are used to define the driving waveform. In the SSD1680, there are 159 bytes in the waveform setting to store LUT0, LUT1, LUT2, LUT3 and LUT4, gate voltage, source voltage and frame rate. The waveform LUT of a particular temperature range can be loaded from OTP or written by MCU.

* WS byte 0~152, the content of VS[nX-LUTm], TP[nX], RP[n], SR[nXY], FR[n] and XON[nXY] are defined by Register 0x32
* WS byte 153, the content of Option for LUT end, is the parameter belonging to Register 0x3F.
* WS byte 154, the content of gate level, is the parameter defined by Register 0x03.
* WS byte 155~157, the content of source level, is the parameter defined by Register 0x04.
* WS byte 158, the content of VCOM level, is the parameter defined by Register 0x2C.

### 6.8 Temperature Searching
The SSD1680 has internal temperature sensor to detect the environment temperature or can communicate with the external temperature sensor by I2C single master interface or can communicate with the external MCU to get the temperature value through SPI. In the SSD1680, there is a dedicated format for the temperature value so that the driver IC can understand it. The format of temperature value is described in Section 6.8.3.

### 6.8.1 Internal Temperature Sensor
The internal temperature sensor can be selected by command register. The accuracy of it is ±2degC from -25degC to 50degC.

### 6.8.2 External Temperature Sensor I2C Single Master Interface
The driver IC can communicate with the external temperature sensor through I2C single master interface (TSDA and TSCL). TSDA will be SDA and TSCL will be SCL. TSDA and TSCL are required to connect with external pull-up resistor. Temperature register value of external temperature sensor can be read by command register.

### 6.8.3 Format of temperature value
The temperature value is defined by 12-bit binary. The rules are shown as below.
- If the Temperature value MSByte bit D11 = 0, then the temperature is positive and value (DegC) = + (Temperature value) / 16
- If the Temperature value MSByte bit D11 = 1, then the temperature is negative and value (DegC) = - (2's complement of Temperature value) / 16

Table 6-7 shows some examples of 12-bit binary temperature value:

**Table 6-7 : Example of 12-bit binary temperature settings for temperature ranges**
| 12-bit binary (2's complement) | Hexadecimal Value | TR Value [DegC] |
|---|---|---|
| 0111 1111 1111 | 7FF | 128 |
| 0111 1111 1111 | 7FF | 127.9 |
| 0110 0100 0000 | 640 | 100 |
| 0101 0000 0000 | 500 | 80 |
| 0100 1011 0000 | 4B0 | 75 |
| 0011 0010 0000 | 320 | 50 |
| 0001 1001 0000 | 190 | 25 |
| 0000 0000 0100 | 004 | 0.25 |
| 0000 0000 0000 | 000 | 0 |
| 1111 1111 1100 | FFC | -0.25 |
| 1110 0111 0000 | E70 | -25 |
| 1100 1001 0000 | C90 | -55 |

### 6.9 Waveform Setting searching mechanism
As mentioned in Section 6.7, the SSD1680 OTP can store waveform setting and temperature range. If waveform setting and temperature range are programmed in OTP memory, corresponding waveform LUT can be selected according to the sensed temperature to drive the display. The Waveform Setting searching mechanism by driver IC is as follows.

1) Read temperature value by command register in the format of 12-bit binary.
2) According to read temperature and display mode selection, search LUT in OTP from TR0 to TR35 in sequence. The last match will be selected, then, the corresponding WS will be loaded in the LUT register to drive the display.

**Remark**: Waveform LUT selection criteria is "Lower temperature bound < Sensed temperature ≤ Upper temperature bound".

Table 6-8 shows an example for the waveform LUT searching from OTP:
- If the read temperature is 25degC, then, WS4 will be selected.
- If the read temperature is 34degC, then, WS7 will be selected. Although 34degC is also in the temperature range TR6, according to searching mechanism, the last match should be selected. Therefore, WS7 is selected.

**Table 6-8 : Example of waveform settings selection based on temperature ranges.**
| Waveform LUT in OTP | Temperature Range in OTP | TR Lower Limit [Hex] | TR Upper Limit [Hex] | Temperature range in OTP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WS0 | TR0 | 800 | 050 | -128 DegC < Temperature ≤ 5 DegC |
| WS1 | TR1 | 050 | 0A0 | 5 DegC < Temperature ≤ 10DegC |
| WS2 | TR2 | 0A0 | 0F0 | 10 DegC < Temperature ≤ 15DegC |
| WS3 | TR3 | 0F0 | 140 | 15 DegC < Temperature ≤ 20DegC |
| WS4 | TR4 | 140 | 190 | 20 DegC < Temperature ≤ 25DegC |
| WS5 | TR5 | 190 | 1E0 | 25 DegC < Temperature ≤ 30DegC |
| WS6 | TR6 | 1E0 | 230 | 30 DegC < Temperature ≤ 35DegC |
| WS7 | TR7 | 210 | 7FF | 33 DegC < Temperature ≤ 127.9DegC |
| Others | Others | 000 | 000 | |

**Precaution:**
Please ensure the temperature range covers whole range of application temperatures, display will not be updated if no suitable temperature range matches the sensed temperature.

### 6.10 One Time Programmable (OTP) Memory
In the SSD1680, there is an embedded OTP memory which is designed to store the waveform settings of different temperature range and some variables/parameters. The OTP memory can store 36 sets of waveform LUT settings (WS), 36 sets of temperature range (TR), VCOM value, display mode selection, waveform version and user ID. Figure 6-7 shows the address mapping of the 36 waveform setting (WS0 to WS35) and temperature range (TR0 to TR35).

*[Diagram: The Waveform setting mapping in OTP for waveform setting and temperature range]*

**Figure 6-7 : The Waveform setting mapping in OTP for waveform setting and temperature range**

### 6.11 The Format for Temperature Range (TR)
The format of TR Lower limit and Upper limit as shown in Figure 6-8 which temp_L[11:0] is the lower limit and temp_H[11:0] is the upper limit of the temperature range. There has 36sets of TR for waveform LUT searching.

**Table 6-9: Format of Temperature Range (TR) in OTP**
| D7 | D6 | D5 | D4 | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| | | temp_L[7:0] | | | | | |
| temp_H[3:0] | | | | temp_L[11:8] | | | |
| | | temp_H[11:4] | | | | | |

### 6.12 Cascade Mode
SSD1680 has a cascade mode that can cascade 2 chips to achieve the display resolution up to 352 (sources) x 296 (gates). The pin M/S# is used to configure the chip. When M/S# is connected to VDDIO, the chip is configured as a master chip. When M/S# is connected to VSS, the chip is configured as a slave chip.

When the chip is configured as a master chip, it will be the same as a single chip application, ie, all circuit blocks will be worked as usual. When the chip is configured as a slave chip, its oscillator and booster & regulator circuit will be disabled. The oscillator clock and all booster voltages will be come from the master chip. Therefore, the corresponding pins including CL, VDD, VGH, VGL, VSH1, VSH2, VSL, VGL and VCOM must be connected to the master chip.

### 6.13 VCI Detection
The VCI detection function is used to detect the VCI level when it is lower than Vlow, threshold voltage set by register.

In SSD1680, there is a command to execute the VCI detection function. When the VCI detection command is issued, the VCI detection will be executed. During the detection period, BUSY output is at high level. BUSY output is at low level when the detection is completed. Then, user can issue the Status Bit Read command to check the status bit for the result of VCI, which 0 is normal, 1 is VCI<Vlow.

### 6.14 HV Ready Detection
The HV Ready detection function is used to detect whether the analog block is ready.

In SSD1680, there is a command to execute the HV Ready detection function. When the HV Ready detection command is issued, the HV Ready will be executed. During the detection period, BUSY output is at high level. BUSY output is at low level when the detection is completed. Then, user can issue the Status Bit Read command to check the status bit for the result of HV Ready, which 0 is normal, 1 indicate HV is not ready.

## 8 COMMAND DESCRIPTION

### 8.1 Driver Output Control (01h)
This triple byte command has multiple configurations and each bit setting is described as follows:

| R/W | DC | IB7 | IB6 | IB5 | IB4 | IB3 | IB2 | IB1 | IB0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W | 1 | MUX7 | MUX6 | MUX5 | MUX4 | MUX3 | MUX2 | MUX1 | MUX0 |
| POR | | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

| POR | | | | | | | | | 1 |
| W | 1 | | | | | | GD | SM | TB |
| POR | | | | | | | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**MUX[8:0]:** Specify number of lines for the driver: MUX[8:0] + 1. Multiplex ratio (MUX ratio) from 16 MUX to 296MUX.

**GD:** Selects the 1st output Gate
This bit is made to match the GATE layout connection on the panel. It defines the first scanning line.

**SM:** Change scanning order of gate driver.
When SM is set to 0, left and right interlaced is performed.
When SM is set to 1, no splitting odd / even of the GATE signal is performed.
Output pin assignment sequence is shown as below (for 296 MUX ratio):

| Driver | SM=0<br>GD=0 | SM=0<br>GD=1 | SM=1<br>GD=0 | SM=1<br>GD=1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### 8.3 Data Entry Mode Setting (11h)
This command has multiple configurations and each bit setting is described as follows:

| R/W | DC | IB7 | IB6 | IB5 | IB4 | IB3 | IB2 | IB1 | IB0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W | 1 | | | | | | AM | ID1 | ID0 |
| POR | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

**ID[1:0]:** The address counter is automatically incremented by 1, after data is written to the RAM when ID[1:0] = “01”. The address counter is automatically decremented by 1, after data is written to the RAM when ID[1:0] = “00”. The setting of incrementing or decrementing of the address counter can be made independently in each upper and lower bit of the address. The direction of the address when data is written to the RAM is set by AM bits.

**AM:** Set the direction in which the address counter is updated automatically after data are written to the RAM. When AM = “0”, the address counter is updated in the X direction. When AM = “1”, the address counter is updated in the Y direction. When window addresses are selected, data are written to the RAM area specified by the window addresses in the manner specified with ID[1:0] and AM bits.

| | ID [1:0]=”00”<br>X: decrement<br>Y: decrement | ID [1:0]= “01”<br>X: increment<br>Y: decrement | ID [1:0]=”10”<br>X: decrement<br>Y: increment | ID [1:0]= “11”<br>X: increment<br>Y: increment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AM=“0”<br>X-mode | 00,00h -> 15,127h | 00,00h -> 15,127h | 00,00h -> 15,127h | 00,00h -> 15, 127h |
| AM=“1”<br>Y-mode | 00,00h -> 15,127h | 00,00h -> 15, 127h | 00,00h -> 15, 127h | 00,00h -> 15, 127h |

The pixel sequence is defined by the ID [0].

| | ID[1:0]=”00”<br>X: decrement<br>Y: decrement | ID[1:0]=”01”<br>X: increment<br>Y: decrement |
|---|---|---|
| AM=“0”<br>X-mode | 00,00h -> A,3,C,1 -> 15,127h | 00,00h -> 1,2,3,4 -> 15,127h |

### 8.4 Set RAM X - Address Start / End Position (44h)

> **Datasheet Discrepancy Note:** This section shows XSA[4:0]/XEA[4:0] (5 bits), but the Command Table (Section 7) shows A[5:0]/B[5:0] (6 bits). Analysis: 176 sources ÷ 8 = 22 X addresses, requiring 5 bits (max value 15h=21 decimal). The 5-bit notation here appears correct.

| R/W | DC | IB7 | IB6 | IB5 | IB4 | IB3 | IB2 | IB1 | IB0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W | 1 | | | | XSA4 | XSA3 | XSA2 | XSA1 | XSA0 |
| POR | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| W | 1 | | | | XEA4 | XEA3 | XEA2 | XEA1 | XEA0 |
| POR | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

**XSA[4:0]/XEA[4:0]:** Specify the start/end positions of the window address in the X direction by 8 times address unit. Data is written to the RAM within the area determined by the addresses specified by XSA [4:0] and XEA [4:0]. These addresses must be set before the RAM write.
It allows on XEA [4:0] ≤ XSA [4:0]. The settings follow the condition on 00h ≤ XSA [4:0], XEA [4:0] ≤ 15h. The windows is followed by the control setting of Data Entry Setting (R11h)

### 8.5 Set RAM Y - Address Start / End Position (45h)

| R/W | DC | IB7 | IB6 | IB5 | IB4 | IB3 | IB2 | IB1 | IB0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W | 1 | YSA7 | YSA6 | YSA5 | YSA4 | YSA3 | YSA2 | YSA1 | YSA0 |
| POR | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| W | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | YSA8 |
| POR | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| W | 1 | YEA7 | YEA6 | YEA5 | YEA4 | YEA3 | YEA2 | YEA1 | YEA0 |
| POR | | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| W | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | YEA8 |
| POR | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

**YSA[8:0]/YEA[8:0]:** Specify the start/end positions of the window address in the Y direction by an address unit. Data is written to the RAM within the area determined by the addresses specified by YSA [8:0] and YEA [8:0]. These addresses must be set before the RAM write.
It allows YEA [8:0] ≤ YSA [8:0]. The settings follow the condition on 00h ≤ YSA [8:0], YEA [8:0] ≤ 127h. The windows is followed by the control setting of Data Entry Setting (R11h)

### 8.6 Set RAM Address Counter (4Eh-4Fh)

> **Datasheet Discrepancy Note:** This section shows XAD[4:0] (5 bits), but the Command Table (Section 7) for 0x4E shows A[5:0] (6 bits). This is consistent with the 0x44 discrepancy. The 5-bit notation here appears correct.

| Reg# | R/W | DC | IB7 | IB6 | IB5 | IB4 | IB3 | IB2 | IB1 | IB0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4Eh | W | 1 | | | | XAD4 | XAD3 | XAD2 | XAD1 | XAD0 |
| POR | | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| | W | 1 | YAD7 | YAD6 | YAD5 | YAD4 | YAD3 | YAD2 | YAD1 | YAD0 |
| POR | | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4Fh | W | 1 | | | | | | | | YAD8 |
| POR | | | | | | | | | | 0 |

**XAD[4:0]:** Make initial settings for the RAM X address in the address counter (AC).
**YAD[8:0]:** Make initial settings for the RAM Y address in the address counter (AC).

After RAM data is written, the address counter is automatically updated according to the settings with AM, ID bits and setting for a new RAM address is not required in the address counter. Therefore, data is written consecutively without setting an address. The address counter is not automatically updated when data is read out from the RAM. RAM address setting cannot be made during the standby mode. The address setting should be made within the area designated with window addresses which is controlled by the Data Entry Setting (R11h) {AM, ID[1:0]} ; RAM Address XStart / XEnd Position (R44h) and RAM Address Ystart /Yend Position (R45h). Otherwise undesirable image will be displayed on the Panel.

## 10 Absolute Maximum Rating

**Table 10-1: Maximum Ratings**

| Symbol | Parameter | Rating | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| VCI | Logic supply voltage | -0.5 to +6.0 | V |
| VIN | Logic Input voltage | -0.5 to VDDIO+0.5 | V |
| VOUT | Logic Output voltage | -0.5 to VDDIO+0.5 | V |
| TOPR | Operation temperature range | -40 to +85 | °C |
| TSTG | Storage temperature range | -65 to +150 | °C |

Maximum ratings are those values beyond which damages to the device may occur. Functional operation should be restricted to the limits in the Electrical Characteristics tables or Pin Description section.

This device contains circuitry to protect the inputs against damage due to high static voltages or electric fields; however, it is advised that normal precautions be taken to avoid application of any voltage higher than maximum rated voltages to this high impedance circuit. For proper operation it is recommended that VCI be constrained to the range VSS < VCI. Reliability of operation is enhanced if unused input is connected to an appropriate logic voltage level (e.g., either VSS or VDDIO). Unused outputs must be left open. This device may be light sensitive. Caution should be taken to avoid exposure of this device to any light source during normal operation. This device is not radiation protected.

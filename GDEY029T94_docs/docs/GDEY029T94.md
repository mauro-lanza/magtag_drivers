**Note**: Maximum ratings are those values beyond which damages to the device may occur. Functional operation should be restricted to the limits in the Panel DC Characteristics tables.

### 6.2 Panel DC Characteristics
The following specifications apply for: VSS=0V, VCI=3.0V, TOPR=25°C.

| Deep sleep mode current | Idslp_Vci | - | 1 | 5 | uA | DC/DC off, No clock, No input load, Ram data not retain |

**Notes:**
1.  Refresh time: the time it takes for the whole process from the screen change to the screen stabilization.
2.  The difference between different refresh methods:
    *   Full refresh: The screen will flicker several times during the refresh process;
    *   Fast Refresh: The screen will flash once during the refresh process;
    *   Partial refresh: The screen does not flicker during the refresh process.

During the fast refresh or partial refresh of the electronic paper, it is recommended to add a full-screen refresh after 5 consecutive operations to reduce the accumulation of afterimages on the screen.

**Additional Notes:**
1. The typical power is measured with following transition from horizontal 2 scale pattern to vertical 2 scale pattern.
2. The deep sleep power is the consumed power when the panel controller is in deep sleep mode.
3. The listed electrical/optical characteristics are only guaranteed under the controller & waveform provided by GOOD DISPLAY.

### 6.3 Panel AC Characteristics
**6.3.1 MCU Interface Selection**
The pin assignment at different interface mode is summarized in Table 6-4-1. Different MCU mode can be set by hardware selection on BS1 pins. The display panel only supports 4-wire SPI or 3-wire SPI interface mode.

| Pin Name | Data/Command Interface | Control Signal | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bus interface | SDA | SCL | CS# | D/C# | RES# |
| BS1=L 4-wire SPI | SDA | SCL | CS# | D/C# | RES# |
| BS1=H 3-wire SPI | SDA | SCL | CS# | L | RES# |

**6.3.2 MCU Serial Interface (4-wire SPI)**
The serial interface consists of serial clock SCL, serial data SDA, D/C#, CS#. This interface supports Write mode and Read mode.

| Function | CS# | D/C# | SCL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Write command | L | L | ↑ |
| Write data | L | H | ↑ |

**Note**: ↑ stands for rising edge of signal.

In the write mode SDA is shifted into an 8-bit shift register on every rising edge of SCL in the order of D7, D6, ... D0. The level of D/C# should be kept over the whole byte. The data byte in the shift register is written to the Graphic Display Data RAM /Data Byte register or command Byte register according to D/C# pin.

**6.3.3 MCU Serial Interface (3-wire SPI)**
The 3-wire serial interface consists of serial clock SCL, serial data SDA and CS#. This interface also supports Write mode and Read mode. The operation is similar to 4-wire serial interface while D/C# pin is not used. There are altogether 9-bits will be shifted into the shift register on every ninth clock in sequence: D/C# bit, D7 to D0 bit. The D/C# bit (first bit of the sequential data) will determine the following data byte in the shift register is written to the Display Data RAM (D/C# bit = 1) or the command register (D/C# bit = 0).

| Function | CS# | D/C# | SCL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Write command | L | Tie | ↑ |
| Write data | L | Tie | ↑ |

**Note**: ↑ stands for rising edge of signal.

**In the Read mode:**
1. After driving CS# to low, MCU need to define the register to be read.
2. D/C=0 is shifted thru SDA with one rising edge of SCL
3. SDA is shifted into an 8-bit shift register on every rising edge of SCL in the order of D7, D6, ... D0.
4. D/C=1 is shifted thru SDA with one rising edge of SCL
5. SDA is shifted out an 8-bit data on every falling edge of SCL in the order of D7, D6, … D0.
6. Depending on register type, more than 1 byte can be read out. After all byte are read, CS# need to drive to high to stop the read operation.

**6.3.4 Interface Timing**
The following specifications apply for: VSS=0V, VCI=3.0V, TOPR=25°C.

**Serial Interface Timing Characteristics** (VCI - VSS = 2.2V to 3.7V, TOPR = 25°C, CL=20pF)

**Write mode**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fSCL | SCL frequency (Write Mode) | | | 20 | MHz |
| tCSSU | Time CS# has to be low before the first rising edge of SCLK | 60 | | | ns |

| tCSSU | Time CS# has to be low before the first rising edge of SCLK | 100 | | | ns |
